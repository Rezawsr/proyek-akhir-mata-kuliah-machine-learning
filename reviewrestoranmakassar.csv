Hong Kong Restaurant,Patrick Christopher Panggabean,4.0,"Best mee hokkien ive tasted in mks, a bit pricy but definitely worth it. Crispy pig belly with sambal matah is too dry for my taste."
Hong Kong Restaurant,Elisabeth,4.0,This is a very delicious chinnese food...But You have to booked and order first in order to get the food fastest
Hong Kong Restaurant,nisa putri,5.0,"Love the food and place, but sometimes hard to looking parking lot for."
Hong Kong Restaurant,aryanto sultanry,3.0,"This is not a halal restaurant. It serves chinese food. The taste is good, the cleanliness is good, but the waiter is a bit confused with the orders. Hopefully feedback, training or replacement can solve this."
Hong Kong Restaurant,Inggrid Lee,5.0,Very delicious food. This place has been there for years and very well known about the chinese food taste. Very variable menus üëçüèª Suitable for family lunch or dinner. Less parking lot
Hong Kong Restaurant,Faddy Kue,1.0,"The black pepper beef was unbelievable, it didn't taste like black pepper and the meat were severely over cooked. Ordered Ee Fu noodle but regular egg noodle was served. HongKong fried rice is actually regular Makassar style red fried rice, besides adding Chinese sausages, there ain't anything HongKong about it. Salted egg french beans - didn't taste any salted eggs. Fried fish fillet - barely edible because it smells a little bad, probably not fresh at all! Price is way too expensive for such quality. There are way better food elsewhere!"
Hong Kong Restaurant,Robert Lee Veda,3.0,"The place n the taste are good, but the pricing is a little bit expensive. The less thing is the park space for the cars. Hard to find parking space if driving a car"

Rumah Makan Patene,Inggrid Lee,5.0,"(Translated by Google) If it's a standard place, yes. But what's good is the food. I just tried tofu eggs. The seasoning is salty. So if you want, maybe ask for the spices to be separated and then mix it yourself. The mixed rice cake is delicious üëçüèªüòä (Original) Kalo tempatnya sih standar aja ya. Tapi yang enak itu makanannya. Tadi saya coba tahu telur. Bumbunya keasinan. Jadi kalo mau barangkali minta pisah bumbu nanti baru dicampur sendiri. Sama lontong campurnya enakkk üëçüèªüòä"
